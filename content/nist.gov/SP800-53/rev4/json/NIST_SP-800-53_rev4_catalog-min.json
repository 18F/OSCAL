Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","text":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","text":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","text":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","text":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","text":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

sets of user privileges, dynamic access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications.

The above class of mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the subject.","links":[{"href":"#ac-25","rel":"related","text":"AC-25"},{"href":"#sc-11","rel":"related","text":"SC-11"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[1]"},"prose":"the organization defines mandatory access control policies to be enforced over all subjects and objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[2]"},"prose":"the organization defines subjects over which organization-defined mandatory access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[3]"},"prose":"the organization defines objects over which organization-defined mandatory access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[4]"},"prose":"the organization defines subjects that may explicitly be granted privileges such that they are not limited by the constraints specified elsewhere within this control;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.5","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[5]"},"prose":"the organization defines privileges that may be granted to organization-defined subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6]"},"prose":"the information system enforces organization-defined mandatory access control policies over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.a_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](a)"},"prose":"the policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information system;","links":{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.a","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(a)"}},{"id":"ac-3.3.b_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)"},"prose":"a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing any of the following:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.1_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(1)"},"prose":"passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;","links":{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.1","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(b)(1)"}},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.2_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(2)"},"prose":"granting its privileges to other subjects;","links":{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.2","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(b)(2)"}},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)"},"prose":"changing one or more security attributes on:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.a","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[a]"},"prose":"subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.b","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[b]"},"prose":"objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.c","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[c]"},"prose":"the information system;

Additional security safeguards may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer.

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sc-2","rel":"related","text":"SC-2"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-18","rel":"related","text":"SC-18"}]},{"id":"ac-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4[1]"},"prose":"the organization defines information flow control policies to control the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems; and"},{"id":"ac-4_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4[2]"},"prose":"the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on organization-defined information flow control policies."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"EXAMINE"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\ninformation system baseline configuration\\n\\nlist of information flow authorizations\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"INTERVIEW"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"TEST"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}}],"subcontrols":[{"id":"ac-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Object Security Attributes","parameters":[{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined security attributes"},{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined information, source, and destination objects"},{"id":"ac-4.1_prm_3","label":"organization-defined information flow control policies"}],"properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4(1)"},"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system uses { ac-4.1_prm_1 } associated with { ac-4.1_prm_2 } to enforce { ac-4.1_prm_3 } as a basis for flow control decisions."},{"id":"ac-4.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects, and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies.

Organizations can implement more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g., employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false positives)."},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4(8)[1]"},"prose":"the organization defines security policy filters to be used as a basis for enforcing flow control decisions;"},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4(8)[2]"},"prose":"the organization defines information flows for which flow control decisions are to be applied and enforced; and"},{"id":"ac-4.8_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4(8)[3]"},"prose":"the information system enforces information flow control using organization-defined security policy filters as a basis for flow control decisions for organization-defined information flows."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"EXAMINE"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"Access control policy\\n\\ninformation flow control policies\\n\\nprocedures addressing information flow enforcement\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nlist of security policy filters regulating flow control decisions\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"INTERVIEW"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developers"}},{"name":"assessment","properties":{"name":"method","STRVALUE":"TEST"},"parts":{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy"}}]},{"id":"ac-4.9","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Human Reviews","parameters":[{"id":"ac-4.9_prm_1","label":"organization-defined information flows"},{"id":"ac-4.9_prm_2","label":"organization-defined conditions"}],"properties":{"name":"label","STRVALUE":"AC-4(9)"},"parts":[{"id":"ac-4.9_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The information system enforces the use of human reviews for { ac-4.9_prm_1 } under the following conditions: { ac-4.9_prm_2 }."},{"id":"ac-4.9_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where automated flow control decisions are possible.
