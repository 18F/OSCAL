A description of a safeguard or countermeasure designed to satisfy a set of defined security requirements that may be implemented in a system to manage a security or privacy risk.
The definitions of controls vary greatly from one standard or guideline to another in terms of the level of detail and the types of information the definitions include. A control definition may be as simple as, &amp;ldquo;The organization has an access control policy and procedures&amp;rdquo;, but most are considerably more complicated.</description></item><item><title>Catalog</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learnmore/architecture/catalog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learnmore/architecture/catalog/</guid><description>In OSCAL, a catalog is:
A set of security and/or privacy controls. Examples of catalogs include NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, and COBIT. The catalog model in OSCAL refers to any data made available for processing in one of OSCAL&amp;rsquo;s formats for representing catalog information.
An OSCAL catalog is a set of OSCAL controls published as a machine readable document. The catalog for NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4 defines all NIST SP 800-53 controls.</description></item><item><title>Profile</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learnmore/architecture/profile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learnmore/architecture/profile/</guid><description>In OSCAL a profile is:
A specific set of security control requirements; also called a baseline or overlay. A profile represents a selection of controls from one or more catalogs, with configuration or qualification appropriate to the profile&amp;rsquo;s use case. Profiles may be published with the catalogs from which they are derived, or they may be developed and maintained separately. Examples include the control baselines in NIST SP 800-53, the FedRAMP baselines, and NIST SP 800-171 (a controls baseline for CUI/NFO).</description></item></channel></rss>
